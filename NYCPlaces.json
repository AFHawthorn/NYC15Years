I walked out into the rain to find a slice of pizza and managed to get a block or two away from the theater before breaking into tears.

It was late, I didn't think she'd say yes, but she did and my heart lept.  I hadn't planned much further than asking her, so it was a quick punt and we found this spot.  It was 11p on a Sunday night and the bar was empty.  She ordered a Guinness and I only became more smitten.

It was a black and white film class, and I used to walk up from the Financial District to the Village, finishing off whatever roll of film I still had to finish for class.  We took a class trip out to Coney Island while the weather was still cold and the boardwalk and beaches were all empty.  It was my first time visiting Coney Island and it will always hold this magic as being both so quintessentially New York and also so alien to my experience of New York.  A beach?  A boardwalk?  All within reach of a single swipe of a Metrocard?  It was dated, frozen in time.  And, in the winter winds, truly desolate and sad.  I later (much later, 10 years later) visited with Betsy for her birthday.  The weather didn't quite cooperate, she was hoping for a beach day, but we tried to make the most of it anyway.  It's a strange place and, like so much of New York City, refuses to acquiesce to whatever your hopes and dreams for the experience might have been."
